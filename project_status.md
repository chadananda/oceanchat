### Work Done So Far:

- Discussed the high-level architecture and components of the system
- Explored options for mixing Python and JavaScript in the backend (Firebase Functions)
- Outlined the functional components and file stubs for both the backend and frontend
- Discussed the use of GPT-4, Langchain, Pinecone, and Google Authentication

### Next Steps:

1. Implement the frontend UI components, including the chat interface, document ingestion interface, and repository browsing. (Prompt: "How do I implement a chat interface in SvelteKit?")
2. Implement user authentication and role-based access control using Google Authentication and Firebase. (Prompt: "How do I implement role-based access control with Firebase and Google Authentication?")
3. Implement the backend logic for processing chat queries, searching documents, generating responses, and performing actions using GPT-4, Langchain, and Pinecone. (Prompt: "How do I integrate GPT-4 and Langchain into my Firebase Cloud Functions?")
4. Implement language translation and LTR/RTL support in the frontend based on user interactions and browser locale. (Prompt: "How do I implement language translation and LTR/RTL support in SvelteKit?")
5. Add JSDoc headers and descriptions to JavaScript functions for AI consumption. (Prompt: "What is the best practice for writing JSDoc headers for AI consumption?")
6. Implement local tests for Firebase Cloud Functions. (Prompt: "How do I write local tests for Firebase Cloud Functions?")
7. Test and deploy the application. (Prompt: "What are the steps to deploy a SvelteKit application to GitHub Pages and Firebase?")

Note: This summary serves as a high-level overview of the project and the work done so far. Additional details and implementation decisions may be discussed and refined as the project progresses.
